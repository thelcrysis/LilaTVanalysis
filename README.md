# LilaTVanalysis

  Scraping [lichess.org TV](http://www.lichess.org/tv), top rated match in particular. Every featured match section could be scraped by altering _url_ in [main.py](./main.py). Scraping is done with selenium module and firefox _webdriver_. Graph is drawn using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). 

  Whole project will most likely be redone in nodejs hoping to make it real time with nicer and more informative charts. Examples of output can be also seen in repository.
